# getting_started
My first repository.

Hello World! 
My name is Vejn, I am 31 years old and I started 4 months ago to learn the code.
Passionate about gaming and game developing, spent some time with Unity creating random levels for imaginary games.
Other big passion is cycling, and last few years I worked as courier, now is the time for Python :D
I am writing this just to fill up readme file. :D

Greetings, Vejn
